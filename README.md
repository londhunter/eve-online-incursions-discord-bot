### Add the bot to a server

Read official doc [here](https://discordjs.guide/preparations/setting-up-a-bot-application.html) to create your own Discord application and bot.

Replace CLIENT_ID by your own Discord application client id.

```
https://discord.com/api/oauth2/authorize?client_id=<CLIENT_ID>&permissions=534723951680&scope=bot%20applications.commands
```

### Configure the bot

To find your server id (guildId) and channel id, you need to enable development mode on Discord and right-click on your channel/server and press "Copy ID".
Also, don't forget to generate a token for your bot and put it in the config file.

**src/config/config.json**

```json
{
  "clientId": "APP_CLIENT_ID",
  "guildId": "DISCORD_SERVER_ID",
  "channelId": "DISCORD_CHANNEL_ID",
  "token": "APP_BOT_TOKEN",
  "highSecOnly": true
